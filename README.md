## About

Being diagnosed with cancer sucks, I and a team of friends decided to do something about it and Hack Cancer was born. On October 10th – 11th 2015, forty of the best developers and doctors from around the world, gathered at Google Campus to build products to beat cancer.

🎗️ 24 hour hackathon to beat cancer

🎗️ Raised £2800 pounds for Teenage Cancer Trust

🎗️ Sponsored by 17 companies, notably Capital One & Estimote

🎗️ Some amazing cancer beating products built

🎗️ A second Hack Cancer has hosted in San Sebastian in 2018
