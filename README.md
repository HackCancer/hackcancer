Being diagnosed with cancer sucks, I and a team of friends decided to do something about it and Hack Cancer was born. On October 10th – 11th 2015, forty of the best developers and doctors from around the world, gathered at Google Campus to build products to beat cancer.

• 24 hour hackathon to beat cancer

• Raised £2800 pounds for Teenage Cancer Trust

• Sponsored by 17 companies, notably Capital One & Estimote

• Some amazing cancer beating products built
